# Ai Shogi Version 18 For Windows Download: How to Play the World's Strongest Shogi Engine on Your PC
  
Shogi is a two-player strategy board game that has been played in Japan for centuries. It is often referred to as "Japanese chess" due to its similarities to the Western game of chess, but has unique features that make it a distinct game in its own right. One of these features is that captured pieces can be dropped back on the board by the capturing side, making shogi a very dynamic and aggressive game.
  
If you are interested in learning and playing shogi, you might want to try Ai Shogi Version 18, a free and open source shogi engine that is compatible with the Universal Shogi Interface (USI) protocol. Ai Shogi Version 18 is the world's strongest shogi engine, having won the World Computer Shogi Championship (WCSC) 29 times. It can play not only modern shogi on a 9x9 board, but also several variants such as Chu Shogi and Dai Shogi, which are played on larger boards with more pieces.
