Quake 3 Arena is one of the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter games ever released. It has a loyal fan base that still enjoys playing online or on LAN parties.

In this article, we will show you how to set up a Quake 3 1.32 dedicated server on Linux using ioquake3, a modern implementation of the Quake 3 engine.

## What You Will Need
 
- A legitimate copy of Quake 3 Arena. You can buy it from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/Quake_III_Arena/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_iii_gold), or use your original CD-ROM or digital download.
- A Linux server with root access. You can use any Linux distribution that supports ioquake3-server, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
- The ioquake3-server package. You can install it from your distribution's repository or compile it from source.
- The pak0.pk3 file from your Quake 3 installation. This is the main game data file that contains maps, models, sounds, etc.
- The patch zip file from [this page](https://ioquake3.org/extras/patch-data/). This contains updated game data files for Quake 3 and its expansion pack, Team Arena.
- A text editor to edit configuration files.
- An optional firewall or router to forward and open UDP port 27960 to your server.

## Step 1: Create a User for Your Server
 
It is recommended to create a separate user with restricted privileges for running your Quake 3 server. This makes it easier to manage the server and improves security. To create a new user named quake3, run the following commands as root:

    useradd -m -g users -s /bin/bash -d /home/quake3 quake3 # create quake3 user
    passwd quake3 # change quake3's password

Then switch to the new user:

    su - quake3

## Step 2: Install ioquake3-server
 
The ioquake3-server package provides a dedicated server executable for Quake 3 that has many improvements and features over the original one. You can install it from your distribution's repository using your package manager. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, you can run:

    sudo apt-get install ioquake3-server

If you prefer to compile it from source, you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/roguephysicist/q3a-server) on GitHub.
 
## Step 3: Copy pak0.pk3 File
 
The pak0.pk3 file is the main game data file that contains maps, models, sounds, etc. You need to copy it from your Quake 3 installation to your server's baseq3 directory. The baseq3 directory is located at /home/quake3/.q3a/baseq3 by default. You can use scp or rsync to copy the file over SSH, or use a USB drive or other media if you have physical access to your server.
