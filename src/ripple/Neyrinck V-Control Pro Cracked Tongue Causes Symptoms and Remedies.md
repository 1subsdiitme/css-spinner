However, some users may encounter a problem with Neyrinck V-Control Pro that causes a "cracked tongue" issue. This means that the software does not communicate properly with the controller or the DAW, resulting in erratic behavior, missing functions, or error messages. This can be very frustrating and affect your workflow and productivity.
 
Fortunately, there are some possible solutions to fix this issue and restore your V-Control Pro to normal operation. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. Check your license. Neyrinck V-Control Pro requires a Standard or Plus license to work with most controllers. You can purchase a license online from the [Neyrinck Store](https://neyrinck.com/v-control-pro/) or get a free trial license for 30 days. You can activate the license on your computer or on an iLok USB key using the iLok License Manager application.
2. Check your compatibility. Neyrinck V-Control Pro supports various DAWs and media applications on both Mac and Windows platforms. However, not all versions and features are compatible with each other. You can check the [Compatibility Chart](https://neyrinck.com/downloads/v-control-pro/) to see if your setup is supported and what functions are available.
3. Check your connection. Neyrinck V-Control Pro uses a direct Ethernet connection to connect to Control|24, Pro Control, D-Command, and C|24 devices. It uses a USB connection to connect to Command|8 and 003 Console devices. It uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to connect to apps on your tablet or phone. Make sure that your cables, ports, routers, switches, and wireless settings are working properly and securely.
4. Check your settings. Neyrinck V-Control Pro runs as a menu-bar application on your computer. It automatically connects to your DAW and controller when you launch them. However, you may need to adjust some settings in the V-Control Pro software or in your DAW preferences to ensure optimal performance. For example, you may need to select the correct MIDI mode, enable HUI protocol, adjust buffer size, etc.
5. Check your updates. Neyrinck V-Control Pro is constantly updated to fix bugs, improve stability, and add new features. You can download the latest version of the software from the [Download Page](https://neyrinck.com/downloads/v-control-pro/). You should also keep your DAW and controller firmware updated to avoid compatibility issues.
