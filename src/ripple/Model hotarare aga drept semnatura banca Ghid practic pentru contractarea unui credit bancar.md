The SEDRE software allows the user to access the wiring diagrams of each Peugeot model by selecting the vehicle identification number (VIN) or the model and variant. The software also provides information on the location and function of each electrical component, the connectors and terminals, the color codes and symbols, and the troubleshooting procedures. The SEDRE software can be installed on a Windows PC and requires a USB key for activation.

The wiring diagrams of the Peugeot models are divided into different systems, such as engine management, cooling, heating, air conditioning, lighting, instruments, wipers, windows, doors, locks, security, audio, navigation, communication, and so on. Each system has a number of sub-systems that correspond to specific functions or features. For example, the engine management system has sub-systems for fuel injection, ignition, emission control, cruise control, etc. Each sub-system has a wiring diagram that shows the electrical connections and components involved in that sub-system.

The wiring diagrams are presented in a schematic and simplified way, using standard symbols and conventions. The diagrams show the power supply, the ground connections, the switches, the sensors, the actuators, the relays, the fuses, the wires, and the connectors. The diagrams also indicate the color codes of the wires and the pin numbers of the connectors. The diagrams are accompanied by legends that explain the meaning of each symbol and code. The diagrams can be zoomed in or out for better visibility and printed for reference.
