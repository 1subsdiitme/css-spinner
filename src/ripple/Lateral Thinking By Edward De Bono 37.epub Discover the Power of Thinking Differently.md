# Lateral Thinking: A Textbook of Creativity by Edward de Bono
 
Lateral thinking is a term coined by Edward de Bono, a world-renowned writer and philosopher, to describe a way of thinking that is different from the conventional, logical, and linear approach. Lateral thinking involves looking at problems from different perspectives, breaking free from fixed patterns of thought, and generating novel and effective solutions.
 
In his book *Lateral Thinking: A Textbook of Creativity*, de Bono explains the theory and practice of lateral thinking, and provides a series of techniques and exercises to help readers develop this skill. He also shows how lateral thinking can be applied to various fields and situations, such as business, education, science, art, and social issues.

Some of the techniques that de Bono introduces in his book are:
 
- Random entry: using a random word or image to trigger new ideas.
- Provocation: making a deliberately absurd or contradictory statement to challenge assumptions and stimulate new possibilities.
- Movement: shifting the focus from one aspect of a problem to another, or changing the level of abstraction.
- Challenge: questioning the status quo and looking for alternatives.
- Reversal: turning a problem upside down or inside out, or reversing the roles of the elements involved.
- Analogy: finding similarities between different situations or domains.

De Bono argues that lateral thinking is not a natural talent, but a skill that can be learned and improved by anyone. He also claims that lateral thinking is not only useful for solving problems, but also for enhancing creativity, innovation, and happiness. He writes:

> "Lateral thinking is not concerned with generating doubt for the sake of doubt or with being awkward for the sake of being awkward. It is concerned with generating change for the sake of effectiveness. Lateral thinking is not concerned with escaping from reality into fantasy. It is concerned with restructuring reality in order to make it richer."

Lateral thinking can help us overcome mental blocks, challenge assumptions, and generate new ideas. It can also make us more flexible, adaptable, and open-minded. However, lateral thinking is not always easy or intuitive. It requires practice, patience, and curiosity.
 
Fortunately, there are many ways to develop and improve our lateral thinking skills. Some of them are:

- Mind mapping: This is a technique that involves creating a visual representation of a topic or problem, using keywords, images, colors, and connections. Mind mapping can help us organize our thoughts, explore different aspects of a problem, and generate new associations and insights.
- Brainstorming: This is a technique that involves generating as many ideas as possible in a short period of time, without judging or filtering them. Brainstorming can help us overcome mental inertia, stimulate creativity, and discover unexpected solutions.
- Lateral thinking puzzles: These are puzzles that require us to use lateral thinking to find the answer. They often involve paradoxes, contradictions, or unusual scenarios that challenge our conventional logic. Lateral thinking puzzles can help us sharpen our lateral thinking skills, as well as have fun.

Some examples of lateral thinking puzzles are:

1. A man lives on the 10th floor of a building. Every day he takes the elevator to go down to the ground floor to go to work or to go shopping. When he returns he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up the stairs to reach his apartment on the 10th floor. He hates walking so why does he do it? Answer: He is too short to reach the 10th floor button.
2. A man pushed his car to a hotel and lost his fortune. What happened? Answer: He was playing Monopoly.
3. A man is lying dead in a field. Next to him there is an unopened package. There is no other creature in the field. How did he die? Answer: The man had jumped from a plane but his parachute had failed to open. It is the unopened package.

Lateral thinking is a valuable skill that can help us solve problems more effectively and creatively. By learning and applying lateral thinking techniques, we can enhance our thinking abilities and enrich our lives.
