- A Windows PC with an SD card reader.
- A Siemens SIMATIC S7 PLC memory card with an MMC Image S file on it.
- The Unlock\_and\_converter\_MMC\_Image\_S7\_v501.rar file, which you can download from 2shared[^1^] or 2shared[^2^]. This file contains a program that can unlock and convert MMC Image S files to HEX files.
- The Unlock\_and\_converter\_MMC\_Image\_S7-ALSO-PROJECT.zi file, which you can download from CodeBus[^3^]. This file contains a project that can convert HEX files to AWL files, which are the source code files of the PLC program.
- The SIMATIC Manager software, which you can use to open and edit AWL files. You can download this software from the Siemens website or use the CD that came with your PLC.

## How to Unlock and Convert MMC Image S Files
 
Follow these steps to unlock and convert MMC Image S files:

1. Insert your Siemens SIMATIC S7 PLC memory card into your PC's SD card reader.
2. Copy the MMC Image S file from the memory card to your PC. The file name should be something like "MMC\_Image\_S7\_300\_400.img".
3. Extract the Unlock\_and\_converter\_MMC\_Image\_S7\_v501.rar file to a folder on your PC. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to do this.
4. Run the Unlock\_and\_converter\_MMC\_Image\_S7\_v501.exe file in the folder. A window like this should appear:

6. Click on the "Unlock" button. The program will ask you for a password. Enter "plcforum" (without quotes) and click "OK". The program will then unlock and convert the MMC Image S file to a HEX file. The HEX file name should be something like "MMC\_Image\_S7\_300\_400.hex".
7. Extract the Unlock\_and\_converter\_MMC\_Image\_S7-ALSO-PROJECT.zi file to another folder on your PC.
8. Open the SIMATIC Manager software and create a new project.
9. In the project tree, right-click on "Blocks" and select "Import blocks...". A window like this should appear:
