Hylics is not a typical RPG game. It has some unconventional mechanics and features that may confuse or surprise you. Here are some tips to help you enjoy the game more:

- Save often. Hylics does not have an autosave feature, so you will need to manually save your progress at save points, which are TVs scattered around the world. You can also use a remote control item to save anywhere, but they are limited and expensive.
- Use the Sage's tokens. These are special items that you can find or buy in the game. They allow you to access the Sage's rooms, where you can learn new gestures (skills) for your party members. Gestures are very useful in combat and exploration, so don't miss them.
- Explore the dream world. Hylics has a dream world that you can access by sleeping in beds. The dream world is a random and surreal place that changes every time you enter it. You can find items, enemies, secrets, and even bosses in the dream world. Some of them are exclusive to the dream world, so it's worth checking out.
- Experiment with different items and enemies. Hylics has a lot of items and enemies that have different effects and behaviors. Some items can heal you, buff you, debuff enemies, or even transform you into different forms. Some enemies can be friendly, hostile, or indifferent depending on your actions. Try using different items and interacting with different enemies to see what happens.
- Have fun. Hylics is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It has a lot of humor, absurdity, and creativity that make it a unique and enjoyable experience. Don't worry too much about the plot or the logic of the game. Just go with the flow and have fun.

Hylics is a game that will challenge your expectations and imagination. It is a game that will make you laugh, wonder, and appreciate its artistic vision. If you are looking for something different and original, Hylics is a game for you.
